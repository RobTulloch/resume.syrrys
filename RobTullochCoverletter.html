            Chicago, IL, 60604<br><br>
            Dear Human Resources Staff / Support Team Manager:</span></p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">The other day while I was following up on some LinkedIn posts from some of my former Euromonitor colleagues, I was excited to find the posting for the IT Support Executive (1357-003) for which I believe I would be an ideal fit. Some of my fondest and proudest moments from my time at Euromonitor were when I was able to help some of my fellow researchers and consultants setup dual-monitor configurations for their workstations, when I was asked to provide EMMA training for some new analysts and when I was able to occasionally save Ed Jurinek (who was providing contract IT support a the time) a trip into the office.</span>
            </p>

            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">My experience as Research Analyst for Canada has provided me with first hand experience as a user of Euromonitor&rsquo;s IT stack (including EMMA, Passport and Grinder) as well as providing training and tech support for my in country analysts. My more recent experience at Tepromark Architectural Products was focused on setting up, training, administering, documenting, troubleshooting and providing support for a full suite of primarily web-based systems for a small on-site office (VOIP phones, Windows laptops, G-suite/MS Office, Xero cloud accounting), an off-site warehouse (Unleashed Inventory &amp; Order management) and national team of sales agents (Insightly CRM). Continuous business visibility and communication with our company ownership in New Zealand required clear and complete documentation of all issues and progress updates (various custom dashboards &amp; spreadsheets, multi-participant video conferencing). &nbsp;Additionally, I had full ownership of all orders post-sale (scheduling production, ensuring timely job-site delivery and billing), which included making sure that clients and sales agents were kept in the loop regarding any production or shipping delays.
            </span></p>

            <p class="c2"><span>I think I would be able to hit the ground running in this role and provide exceptional support for the Chicago office staff, both sales and research as well as remote analysts across the Americas and customers. </span>
                <span class="c0">I eagerly anticipate the opportunity to speak with you in more depth about my qualifications and experience. Thank you for your consideration. </span></p>
                <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sincerely,</span></p>
                <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rob Tulloch</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"><a class="c3" href="mailto:Rob.tulloch@gmail.com">Rob.Tulloch@gmail.com</a></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">312-971-7226</span></p><p class="c2">
                    <span class="c0">PS I had originally found the posting a couple of days ago while travelling and thought it was such a good fit that I rushed and applied through the LinkedIn Easy Apply. I&rsquo;ve made a couple of small edits and thought it would be beneficial to re-submit to your Silkroad onboarding system</span></p>
